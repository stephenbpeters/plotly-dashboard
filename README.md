This project creates a simple dashboard for viewing data from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset:

http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


This folder contains two files:
* index.html
* samples.json

To get around cacheing issues, I've got the JavaScript code in line inside the HTML.

When viewed, index.html reads the data from samples.json and allows the visitor to select a person 
from the study and view two graphs on the bacteria found in their belly buttons.
